     <u>Emergency Evacuation/Assembly Points</u>
     <p align = "left">
     In the event of an alarm sounding, all classrooms and labs must be evacuated immediately.  Please respond to alarms 
     promptly by leaving the building by the closest available exit.  Faculty and students must remain outside the building 
     until the 'all clear' has been given by a Fire Marshall. In case of emergency, call 220-5333.

     Assembly Points have been identified across campus. These areas have been selected as they are large enough to hold a 
     significant number of people and will provide an evacuated population access to washroom facilities and protection from 
     the elements. More information on assembly points can be found at

     The University of Calgary recognizes the pivotal role that student mental health plays in physical health, social 
     connectedness and academic success, and aspires to create a caring and supportive campus community where individuals 
     can freely talk about mental health and receive supports when needed. We encourage you to explore the mental health 
     resources available throughout the university community, such as counselling, self-help resources, peer support or 
     skills-building available through the SU Wellness Centre (Room 370, MacEwan Student Centre,Â
